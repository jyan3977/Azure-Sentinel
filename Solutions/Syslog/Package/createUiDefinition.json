The Agent for Linux is then able to forward these logs to the Log Analytics/Microsoft Sentinel workspace.\r\n  \r\n  **Underlying Microsoft Technologies used:** \r\n\r\n This solution takes a dependency on the following technologies, and some of these dependencies either may be in [Preview](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) state or might result in additional ingestion or operational costs:\r\n\n  a.
